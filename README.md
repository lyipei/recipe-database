# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

{Describe the relational database you are using.}

{Describe the structure (tables) of the relational database that you created.}

# Development Environment

Tools Used:
- Python 3.13+ - The main programming language used to develop the recipe database software.
- SQLite3 - A lightweight, file-based database system used to store and manage rercipe data. 
- Visual Studio Code - Used as the code editor for writing and debugging Python scripts.

Proggramming Language and Libraries:
- Python - Chosen for its simplicity, readability, and strong support for database operations.
- sqlite3  (Python standard library) - Provides functions to create, read, and delete data from the SQLite database.

Note:
- The software is cross platform and can run on Windows, macOS, or Linux without additional database installation, because SQLite is embedded.
- Python scripts handle database creation, data insertion, updates, deletions, and queries.
